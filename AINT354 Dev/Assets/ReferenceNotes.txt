Reference Game Notes:

Moving and hitting:

 - Movement is suprisingly slow
 - Sprint speed aprox. 2x normal move speed
 - Jump has much greater velocity than movement (aids evasion)
 - Jump is more long than high
 - Original jump velocity + playerInput?
 - Second jump pushes player in direction movement stick is pressed
 - Jump height, feet reach aprox. 2x height of character
 - Second jump resets momentum/gravity
 - Second jump aprox 50% of first height

 - No free movement whilst attacking
    - Attack animations move player slightly
    - Attack animations rotate in direction movement stick is pushed
    - Rotation is maxed to approx 150 degrees either direction?

 - Camera is about height of player behind the character
 - Camera smoothly falls behind and catches up as player moves / attacks
 - Camera follows player movement and lightly rotates as player moves left/right
 - Player faces direction of movement stick
 - Camera and player rotation are independent

 - Attacks have no delay between button press and animation start
 - Animations takes 0.15 secs (maybe about 7 frames) to reach hitbox
 - Aerial attack freezes Y-axis movement and resets any jump momentum
 - Hitboxes much larger than animation suggests
    - Charged attacks have bigger hitboxes and move player further
 - Hitboxes shown by particle effects
 - Particle effect when launching opponent

 - In combos:
    - Quicker next button is pressed, quicker next attack will start
    - Heavy overrides any light attack input
    - Can charge each attack for approx 0.5 secs by holding button
    - Attack used automatically when fully charged
    - Additonal particle effects when fully charged
    - Combo chain lasts for approx 0.5 secs after animation finishes
    - No other actions (exc. dodge and block) can be performed until combo chain over
    - Dodge can lead into another attack (for my proj, will lead into either running or finisher)
    - Full combo covers approx 1.5-2x height of character

 - Dodge is instant, covers about 2.5x height of character
 - Dodge can follow into an attack
 - Can dodge once in air
 - Dodge has 0.5 sec delay afterwards before any other inputs (unless combo'd into an attack)

 - Block prevents all damage but prevents movement (player rotates in movement direction)
 - Block can only be performed when grounded
 - Block is instant
 - Block interrupts combos, but no delay to launch next attack

Getting hit:

 - Certain attacks in combos launch instantly
 - Some attacks launch up (juggle) but finishers launch up and away from attacker //Likely wont use juggle
 - Some attacks slide player across floor without stunning/launching them
 - Gravity lower for falling after launch
 - When launch X-axis/Z-axis momentum is under a certain value, player can dodge out of the stun
 - Dodge from stun instantly transitions to a dodge animation, covered by particle effect
 - Stun after aprox. 3 light attacks
 - Stun lasts 1 sec
 - No stun buildup whilst blocking
 - Charged attacks have amplified Stun/Knockback
